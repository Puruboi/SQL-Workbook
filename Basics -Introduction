# DATA
>>> Raw facts which describes the attributes or properties of any object or entity is called data.
 example: Empolyer (object ) : ID : 101, NAME: puruboi , CONTACT: 987657890 , SALARY: 25000 (attributes and values)
 
 >>>> Consider instagram application identify 3 entities and atleast 3 attributes for each entity.
 >>>> Consider Matrimony Website identify 3 entities and atleast 3 attributes for each entity.
 
 # DataBase
 >>> Place where we store data (in Simple words) 
 >>> Medium where we store data is called Database.
 
 # Features of Data types
 1. Insert / Create 
 2. Read / Retrieve 
 3. Update / Modify 
 4. Delete / Drop 
 
 >>> Every Database should have the above functionalities ( CRUD operations performance of DB is Based on CRUD operations )
 
 # DBMS 
  >>> The software which is used to create, Manage , Manipulate a database is known as DBMS. The complete responsibility of storing and Organising the database is taken care by DBMS software, hence the job of the programmer is only to ask the DBMS to perform Task  such as Create, Update, read, delete.
  
  A programmer can connect his software with the DBMS using DBC ( Database Connector ) programmer can interact with a DBMS software with the help of a Query language.
  
  # Features 
  1. Security 
  2. Authorisation 
  3. CRUD operations
  
  # Different Models Used to organise the data in DB 
  >>> We can organise data in the database using different models such as 
  1. Relational Model 
  2. object oriented Model
  3. Document oreinted Model
  4 . Graphs oriented Model
 
 # DBMS Types 
 >>> A DBMS software can be categorised into 2 
 1. RDBMS Software 
 2. Non DBMS Software 
 
 # RDMS Software 
 >>>  A DBMS Software which stores and organises the data using codd rules is known as RDBMS.
 # Note: The Query language which is used to interact with RDBMS Software is known as SQL
 >>> Example : for RDBMS Software 
      1. MySQL 
      2. Oracle RDBMS
      3. SQL Server 
      4. DB2 
      
 # Non RDBMS Software 
 >>> A DBMS Software which does not follow relational model or codd rules is Broadly classified as Non-RDBMS.
 
 # Note :
 >>> A query language used to interact with non RDBMS is Categorised as No-SQL
 Example :
 1. MONGO DB 
 2. Apache Cassandra DB 
 
# Relational Model 

Codd Rules----> by C.F Codd...

1. According E.F. Codd the data to be stored in the data base including the metadata must be in the form of a logic table 

# table 
>>> Table is a collection of data for similar type of Entities ( Homogeneous ) , A table consists of columns and rows 

# Columns 
>>> Column is a vertical selection of a table which represents a specific attribute of an Entity 
# Note : A column is also known as attribute or field 

# rows 
>>> The horizontal section of a table is known as row. It represents all the attribute of one entity or one object.

# Note: A row is also known as record or tuple.

# Cell 
>>> A smallest unit of a table is knwon as cell, it is used to store the actual data.
